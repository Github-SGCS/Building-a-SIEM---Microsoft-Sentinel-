<h1> Building a SIEM - Microsoft Sentinel </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>
As part of my cybersecurity learning journey, I built a SIEM solution in Microsoft Sentinel to monitor RDP attempts on the local admin profile. RDP is a common attack vector, and securing administrative accounts is critical. I set up Microsoft Sentinel to track and log any RDP access attempts targeting the local admin account. This involved configuring custom detection rules and creating dashboards to visualize potential threats.
